// Basic Theory

// AJAX - asynchronous javascript and XML

// HTTPRequest

// is a set of "web development technique"
// using many web technologies on the "client-side"
// to create asynchronous web applications

// with AJAX, web applications can send and retrieve
// data from a server asychronously (in the background)
// withoug interfering with the display and
// behaviour of the existing page


// We don't use data in XML format anymore.
// we use JSON now.

// we have 3 most common ways to create and send request a server.
// 1. xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
// 2. fetch API (new way of doing)
// 3. axios (this is third party library)
